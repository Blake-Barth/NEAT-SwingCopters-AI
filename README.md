# 🧠 NEAT SwingCopters AI Agent

This project demonstrates a **NEAT** (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)–based AI agent that learns to play **SwingCopters** — a fast-paced game inspired by *Flappy Bird*, where the player (or NEAT algorithm) must navigate through swinging obstacles.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pygame`
- `neat-python`

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

🎮 How to Play Manually

To play the game yourself, run:

python play_game.py

Controls:

    🖱️ Click to start the game

    🖱️ Click again to change the copter’s direction

    ␣ Press Space to restart after a game over

Try to avoid the swinging obstacles and aim for the highest score!
🤖 Watch the NEAT Algorithm Play

To watch the NEAT algorithm learn and play the game, run:

python run_NEAT.py

The algorithm will evolve and control the copter automatically, improving its performance over generations.
